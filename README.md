### Howdy 🖖🏻

Current Agenda:
- 🌱 I am currently learning c# through creating console apps. I am putting these fundamentals to the test by developing a text based RPG.
- 🐘 I have been exercising my knowledge of php basics by hosting my own web registration forms linked to MySQL databases.
- 🐍 After finishing my first Python project: Spaced Repetition Vocabulary Learning Game, I am eager to strengthen my Python skills with new projects!
- 👁️‍🗨️ I am looking into consolidating my skills with SQL and creating RESTful APIs. I am focusing on building responsive full-stack web applications.
